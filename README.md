# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.

### Purpose
  The project objective is to help hopeful playwirght, Louise, analyze her project campaign to see what type of plays people want to see and how much of the play fundraiser goals were successfully met, failed or canceled. We used data that was obtained from play fundraisers conducted in different countries over a 10-year timespan.

## Analysis and Challenges
  My approach to analyzing the information was first to understand what the data entailed. I familiarized myself with the column headers, the data within the column cells, the formatting of the data and how much of the data was presented. I filtered, sorted and used the conditional formatting feature in certain columns so data that met my set criteria was highlighted in a certain color to emphasize or differentiate among the data stored in a spreadsheet. I used formulas to find the percentage, counts, sum, format dates and to lookup data in given cells. I created pivot tables to filter and count similar groups of data, which made it easier to view. I then used graphs to visually present the data and statistics. All the steps mentioned above allowed the numerous rows and columns of data to be easily reviewed by the end user, Louise, so that she could make the best decision regarding what plays have the most successful fundraising outcome.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
  I personally didn’t experience any challenges during this project, but I could see where someone might get confused while trying to follow the steps outlined in the modules. Since the steps build on one another, one step that is wrong will affect future steps. It’s very important to make sure that the steps are followed in the correct order and completed with accuracy. 

## Results
  The two conclusions that can be drawn from the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date data is that there are more successful launch date outcomes than failed and canceled, and the most successful launch dates were conducted in May and June. By reviewing the Outcomes Based on Goals data it could be concluded that the goal range of 1000 to 4999 was successful 388 of the time and failed 146 of the time. The two limitations of the dataset are that the selection of countries surveyed could be larger and maybe the launch date information could be more current if Louise plans on putting a play in production this year and wants to account for recent global economic difficulties. Additional tables could be created to see what other parent categories like the publishing goal was successful, failed or canceled. A pivot table and line graph could he created to depict the outcomes visually.
